"@keri-ts/verifier": minor
"@keri-ts/tufa": patch
---

Extract the existing credential verifier application, cue store, business policy and webhook workflow into `@keri-ts/verifier`. Tufa retains CLI registration and host composition and consumes the package directly; verifier imports move from `@keri-ts/tufa/runtime` to the new public package without a forwarding facade.
