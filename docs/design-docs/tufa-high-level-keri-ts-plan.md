# TUFA - Trustless Utilities For Agents

TUFA is a set of libraries, infrastructure components, and user interfaces that
provide scalable security for AI Agents, and broader web infrastructure.

_Tufa_ (derived from the Latin tofus or tophus) referred to a soft, porous, and
lightweight stone that was foundational to the architecture of early Rome and
Etruria. It was commonly used for walls, temples, and tomb construction before
being largely replaced by travertine and concrete in the later Republican
period.
