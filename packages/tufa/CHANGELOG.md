# @keri-ts/tufa

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `tufa dws bind`, `tufa dws generate`, `tufa dws resolve`,
  `tufa dws resolver`, `tufa dkr resolve`, static/dynamic did:webs artifact
  hosting, and Universal Resolver `/1.0/identifiers` routing.
- 888bd90: Rename IPEX and multisig runtime CLI controls to `--approval-timeout`, `--poll-turns`, and `--poll-budget-ms`, and validate those values before command runtime startup.
- 888bd90: Add public multisig lifecycle commands plus multisig-aware VC and IPEX workflows, including group registry inception, credential issuance, grant approval, and counter profile selection.

### Patch Changes

- Add documentation for IPEX and VC features.
- 888bd90: Remove OOBI URL-derived endpoint hint persistence and reject missing Tufa startup endpoint config instead of synthesizing `/loc/scheme` or `/end/role/add` state.
- 888bd90: Add explicit multisig mailbox authorization support through `tufa mailbox add --multisig-mode` and share the group endpoint-role proposal path with `tufa ends add` and `tufa multisig rpy`.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 6286759: Release the ACDC/TEL/IPEX implementation as v0.8.0 across Tufa, CESR, and
  KERI packages, including the end-to-end issuer, holder, verifier, KERIpy
  interop, credential-chain, revocation, and saidification workflows.

### Patch Changes

- b7fb4e0: Add registry-backed VC and IPEX CLI operations for schema import, registry
  management, credential create/list/export/import/revoke, and single-sig
  grant/admit artifact workflows.
- 9bd9030: Fix ACDC credential presentation proof serialization for KLI-issued
  credentials, add a separate Sally-style `tufa hook demo` webhook target, and
  cover KLI issuer -> Tufa holder -> Tufa verifier interop through the public
  CLI workflow.
- b0db7b1: Add KLI-holder and mixed KLI/Tufa credential-chain interop support, including
  bounded `tufa ipex poll` mailbox processing, KERIpy-compatible forwarded ACDC
  support payload handling, bidirectional revocation propagation, and I2I/NI2I
  mixed-chain verifier gates with a KERIpy IPEX message-length preflight for the
  known local `serializeMessage` quadlet-alignment bug.
- 1f82a5d: Add KERIpy-shaped multisig EXN coordination for registry inception, issue,
  revoke, replies, and wrapped IPEX proposals, including runtime registration,
  lead election, and `ipex join --auto` approval support.
- b9abf12: Add the ACDC/VDR foundation: credential mailbox routing, IPEX route handlers,
  schema data OOBI resolution and hosting, parser VDR dispatch seams, and the
  KERIpy-shaped Reger storage owner.
- 580bf65: Add a Sally-like verifier agent with durable verifier cue storage, grant-driven
  presentation processing, revocation webhook handling, schema-validator config
  support, and the `tufa verifier run` command.
- 205a9e9: Persist verifier revocation acknowledgements separately from issuance
  acknowledgements and rescan saved TEL state so `tufa verifier run --once`
  emits revocation webhooks correctly after credential imports in prior CLI
  processes.
- 9bd9030: Add a KLI-compatible `tufa saidify` command for in-place JSON SAD
  saidification, including schema `$id` support and KLI output parity coverage.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Align KERI and Tufa with the 0.7.0 release train after the CESR CLI break so generated npm artifacts depend on the 0.7.0 package line.

### Patch Changes

- 87940ec: Move Tufa npm build, host health wait, version generation, and smoke-test
  helpers into checked shared scripts.
- 87940ec: Normalize the Tufa npm `bin.tufa` entry to a bare relative path so npm publish
  does not rewrite package metadata.
- 87940ec: Harden Tufa npm packaging by deriving module and CLI bin paths from DNT output
  and validating those targets in tarball and install smoke tests.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Complete delegation communication support for interop release readiness, including notification-backed delegation flows, mailbox/reply processing fixes, and npm artifact build validation needed for staged publication.
