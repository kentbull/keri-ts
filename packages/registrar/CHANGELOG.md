# @keri-ts/registrar

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Release 2.1.0 for every published package. It adds the SEDI `I1I` and `DI1I` issuer-identity Edge operators with KERIpy's open Grant walk as the default, a pluggable store contract (ADR-0015) that lets `keri-ts/db` and `keri-ts/runtime` be bundled for a browser over `MemStore` or IndexedDB-backed `WebDBer`, automatic registry root replication to group members at issuance and after rotation, and KERIpy's handling of v2 ACDC sections without a top-level `d`.

  This release contains breaking changes. Upgrade every `@keri-ts/*` package and `cesr-ts` together and follow the [upgrade guide](../../docs/reference/compatibility/MIGRATING_FROM_2_0.md).

  **Breaking changes**

  - The native LMDB surface moves from `keri-ts/db` to `keri-ts/db/lmdb`: `LMDBer`, `PathManager`, `openLMDB`, the `create*` store factories and, from `keri-ts/runtime`, `createHabery`. `openRegistry` requires an `opener` and loses `web`; `openLmdbRegistry` is the LMDB default.
  - Host-only transport moves from `keri-ts/runtime` to `keri-ts/runtime/node`: `Configer` and `createConfiger`, `NodeHttpClient`, `TCPMessenger`, `TCPStreamMessenger`, the TCP send helpers, `socketBytes` and `fileBytes`. `FetchHttpClient` can no longer reach `tcp:` endpoints; use `NodeHttpClient`.
  - The new `openHabery` needs a `StoreOpener` or borrowed stores, and one of `cf`, `createConfig` or `skipConfig`. `createHabery` keeps its arguments.
  - `Baser`, `Keeper`, `Reger`, `Noter`, `Mailboxer`, `RegBaser`, `WalletBaser` and `VerifierCueBaser` compose over an injected `DBer`; their constructors take a store and their LMDB path statics become `Family`. `Suber`, `Komer` and `LMDBer` table methods take an opaque `Table`.
  - `LMDBer` behavior: empty dupsort values and empty or over-long keys throw `DatabaseKeyError`, `addVal` no longer accepts `null`, duplicate reads of an empty key report absent, and failures raise `DatabaseKeyError`, `DatabaseNotOpenError` or `DatabaseOperationError` instead of a bare `Error`.
  - Config files move from `keri/cf/{base}/{name}/{name}.json` to `keri/cf/{base}/{name}.json`, the default `Configer` base is `main`, and the `--compat` home fallback is `~/.keri/cf`. Absolute `--base` and names are refused, the store directory is set to owner-only mode on every open, and an unusable store directory falls back to the home directory.
  - Delivery to a recipient, witness or mailbox whose latest accepted event is KERI v1 fails with `PeerVersionError` instead of sending v2.
  - Grants walk open by default, as in KERIpy. `walkIpexGraph` takes a `"open" | "closed"` policy instead of a boolean and `AcdcGraph` carries it as `walk`; pass `grantWalk: "closed"` for the 2.0 refusal of every Grant that omits a far node.
  - Edge chain evaluation follows KERIpy more strictly: unrecognized unary operators and `NOT` are non-retryable unknowns, every schema pin is checked, and a list, falsy or `n`/`w`-bearing Edge Section is malformed.
  - A v2 ACDC attribute, edge or rule section without a top-level `d` is no longer given one. The bytes and SAID built for such a body change to KERIpy's; credentials authored by 2.0.x keep their inserted `d` and still verify.
- d80ccc5: Move to `cesr-ts` and `keri-ts` 2.1.0 so this package and its dependents no longer install libsodium.

### Patch Changes

- c22f1c6: Breaking: `keri-ts/db` and `keri-ts/runtime` are backend-neutral and the native LMDB surface moves to `keri-ts/db/lmdb`. Import `LMDBer` and its options and defaults, `PathManager`, `openLMDB`, `createLMDBer`, `readStoredLmdbMapSize`, `resolveLmdbMapSize`, `clearDatabaserDir`, `BinKey`, `BinVal`, the `create*` store factories and `createHabery` from `keri-ts/db/lmdb`. `openRegistry` now requires an `opener` and loses its `web` option; `openLmdbRegistry` replaces its LMDB default.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 1f23273: Depend on keri-ts 2.0.1, which rejects credentials whose body does not match their SAID. These packages pin keri-ts to an exact version, so they must be republished for the fix to reach their installs.

## 2.0.0

First npm release, coordinated with cesr-ts and keri-ts 2.0.0.

### Minor Changes

- Run Registrar and Observer through normal TLS service commands with persistent private account enrollment. Keep configured Observer source access separate from revocable wallet publication/read permissions, and preserve both service state and permissions across restart.
- Add the public registrar application package for allow-listed signed publication and bulk registry queries, reusing native KEL/TEL acceptance and public HTTP hosting.

### Patch Changes

- Add scheduled HTTPS source observation and signed cache-only registry queries, with exact accepted heads and explicit freshness. Preserve CESR-v2 framing across full evidence replay and native query storage.
